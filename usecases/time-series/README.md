This is a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) using a single LSTM layer, as described
in our paper.

To build the use case, execute ```make``` for the coroutine-based version,
or ```make sequential``` for the sequential version. The executable name is
```rnn``` (coroutine-based) or ```rnn-seq``` (the sequential version). 
Execution will print the timestamp and duration at the end of each execution cycle.
